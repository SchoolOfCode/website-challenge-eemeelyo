DESCRIPTION:
This is my first project with School of Code wherein I made a profile website for my first client who is my partner in our group.
This was done using HTML and CSS.

PLANNING:
I have first gathered some information of my client as well as asking for any specific preferences that she would like forher profile website.

THOUGHTS:
This was a great challenge for me because it forced me to learn new things and polished up the things that I already know.
