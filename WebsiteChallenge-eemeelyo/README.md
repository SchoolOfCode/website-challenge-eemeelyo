DESCRIPTION:
This is my first project with the School of Code Bootcamp, wherein I made a profile website for my first client who is my partner in our group.

MATERIALS:
This was done using HTML and CSS with some images and color that was agreed by the customer to be included in her website.

PLANNING:
I have first gathered some information of my client as well as asking for any specific preferences that she would like for her profile website. I also went digging around as to what would be a suitable design for my client.

THOUGHTS:
This was a great challenge for me because it forced me to learn new things and polished up the things that I already know. It feels really different when you are learning by yourself and in a group because I make myself go into hyperdrive in order to keep up with what is being thought. I am really enjoying the School Of Code Bootcamp and I am looking forward for more education.
